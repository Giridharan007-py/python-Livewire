                  # lambda function
A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Lambda functions are often used for short, simple operations where a full function definition is unnecessary. 
Syntax


lambda arguments: expression
lambda: Keyword to define a lambda function.
arguments: Comma-separated list of input arguments.
expression: Single expression that is evaluated and returned.
Example
Python

add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8
In this example, add is a lambda function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns their sum.
Use Cases
Short, simple operations:
Lambda functions are ideal for concise operations that can be expressed in a single line.
Higher-order functions:
They are commonly used with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted() to apply operations to iterables.
Inline functions:
Lambda functions can be defined and used directly within other expressions or function calls.
Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4]
Limitations
Lambda functions can only contain one expression, limiting their complexity.
They cannot include statements like return, if, or for.
For more complex logic, a regular function definition using def is more appropriate.
